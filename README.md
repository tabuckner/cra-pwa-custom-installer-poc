# CRA-PWA-CUSTOM-INSTALLER-POC

## How To Use
* Install deps
* Build with `--prod`
* Start local server (e.g. `npx serve -S build`)
* Visit in browser
* See the things.

## Caveats
In order for PWA Installation to work, several criteria must be met. HTTPS is one of those criteria. Keep that in mind while testing this in device emulators/simulators.
